# materialflowlist

`materialflowlist` is a Python package that generates and provides a standardized material flow list 
 as well as mappings to convert data from other sources. 

v0.1 produces an alpha version of the material flow list in the style of the [Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List) and the associated `fedelemflowlist` package. This list has a total of 2066 flows. These are organized into 12 classes ('Aggregate', 'Glass', 'Leather', 'Metal', 'Mineral', 'Other petroleum products', 'Paper', 'Biomass', 'Plastic', 'Textile', 'Wood', and 'Energy'), with 81 unique flowables, and 266 unique contexts.  This version has not undergone formal EPA quality assurance. Mappings are including in to map from waste flows in the CalRecycle 2014 Commercial Waste Characterization study, the EPA CDDPath method, and the  RCRAInfo 2019 Biennial report.
