# materialflowlist

`materialflowlist` is a Python package that generates and provides a standardized material flow list 
 as well as mappings to convert data from other sources. 

 Standard formats for a [Flow List](./format%20specs/FlowList.md)
 and a [Flow Mapping](./format%20specs/FlowMapping.md) are defined and provided by `materialflowlist`.
  They are implemented as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes.
   Standard formats are also described for the input files used in building the flow list, and implemented as .csv files
   in the [input](https://github.com/USEPA/materialflowlist/tree/master/materialflowlist/input) directory.  

 The version of the package (see [Releases](https://github.com/USEPA/materialflowlist/releases/))
 corresponds to the version of the flow list that it provides. The complete or 'master' list contains all flows.
